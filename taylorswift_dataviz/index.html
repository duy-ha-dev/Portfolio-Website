                                <h2 class="link-hover-fx" data-animation="animated fadeInRight">Introduction</h2>
                                <p class="carousel-item-description" data-animation="animated fadeInRight">In this project, I am interested in exploring this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thespacefreak/taylor-swift-spotify-data" class="link-hover-fx" >dataset</a> containing information on all her album songs collected through Spotify's API. The goal for this exploration is to gain insights into factors that contribute to the popularity of Taylor Swift's music and to identifty key features that make up a song of hers. </p>
                                <p class="carousel-item-description" data-animation="animated fadeInRight">To achieve this objective, I plan to define several key column variables based on the data available in the dataset and investigate their relationship, or lack thereof, to the popularity of the release. By analyzing the correlation between these variables and the popularity of the songs, I hope to identify the most significant factors that contribute to the success of Taylor Swift's music.</p>
                                <p class="carousel-item-description" data-animation="animated fadeInRight">The findings from this analysis will help me predict the trends in Taylor Swift's music and enable me to identify the most popular songs in future albums. Expansion on this project (such incorporating samples from other top artists) will be useful for individuals who are interested in understanding the factors that influence the popularity of music and predicting future trends and the dynamics of the music industry</p>

                                        <b class="link-hover-fx">popularity</b> The popularity of the track. The value will be between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular.

                                        <b class="link-hover-fx">danceability</b> Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b class="link-hover-fx">acousticness</b> A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b class="link-hover-fx">energy</b> A perceptual measure of intensity and activity

                                        <b class="link-hover-fx">instrumentalness</b> Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. "Ooh" and "aah" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly "vocal". The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b class="link-hover-fx">liveness</b> Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b class="link-hover-fx">loudness</b> The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typically range between -60 and 0 db.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b class="link-hover-fx">speechiness</b> Presence of spoken words in a track (if the speechiness of a song is above 0.66, it is probably made of spoken words, a score between 0.33 and 0.66 is a song that may contain both music and words, and a score below 0.33 means the song does not have any speech)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b class="link-hover-fx">valence</b> A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b class="link-hover-fx">tempo</b> Beats per minute

                    <p class="section-text-ct">It is important to note, before concluding this sectional analysis of popularity and speechiness, that Taylor Swift re-added all of her music to Spotify in 2017. This means that it is very probable that each song's popularity is affected by recency bias. In the context of music streaming, this means that people are more likely to listen to songs that have been released recently; thus, it is likely that many of her older songs will not be played as often on Spotify as her songs released around 2017, such as her album 1989.</p>
